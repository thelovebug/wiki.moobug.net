!!! information
    This is a living document as my Pi deployments change regularly, so it may change frequently.

!!! tip
    My current Pi count (estimate) is **15**.

## Raspberry Pi 400

* Originally used as my Shack PC, but I "upgraded" it to an old laptop which was much quicker.  So at the moment it's not doing anything.  #AmateurRadio
