# :simple-raspberrypi: Raspberry Pis

!!! info "This is a living document as my Pi deployments change regularly, so it may change frequently."

!!! tip "My current Pi count (estimate) is _16_."

## Raspberry Pi 5

1. Bought one of these to use as a Docker host for a bunch of applications: some to test, some to use.  Active cooler and 500GB NVMe installed.  Current containers hosted include:

    - [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io/) - Effortless Container Management for Docker and Kubernetes
    - [Nginx Proxy Manager](https://nginxproxymanager.com/) - Expose your services easily and securely
    - [Homer](https://homer-demo.netlify.app/) - A very simple static homepage for your server
    - [Hamclock](https://github.com/ChrisRomp/hamclock-docker) - invaluable resource for Amateur Radio operators
    - [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) - Open source home automation; not currently using
    - [Immich](https://immich.app/) - Self-hosted photo and video management solution
    - [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/) - The Free Software Media System
    - [Mealie](https://mealie.io/) - Recipe Management For The Modern Household

## Raspberry Pi 400

1. Originally used as my Shack PC, but I "upgraded" it to an old laptop which was much quicker.  So at the moment it's not doing anything.  #AmateurRadio

## Raspberry Pi 3B

!!! info inline end "At least one of these will be a 3B+"

1. **MotionEye**
  Acts as a hub for my CCTV system, using two Pi Zero W's as cameras
  
2. **OctoPi**
  Acts as the controller for my 3D printer running OctoPi

3. **FR24 feeder**
  I'm feeding ADS-B (flight data) to FlightRadar24 and OARC Feeder with this.

## Raspberry Pi 3A+

1. **DMR Hotspot**
  Acts as a DMR/POCSAG hotspot for my shack #AmateurRadio

2. **YSF Hotspot**
  Acts as a YSF hotspot for my shack #AmateurRadio

## Raspberry Pi 2B

1. **G7RPG microHUB**
  Acts as an Allstar node for my shack #AmateurRadio

2. I believe I have another one of these kicking around somewhere

## Raspberry Pi 1B

1. I believe I have two of the original 2012-02-29 run Pis, bought from Premier Farnell
2. and RS Components on the day of their release.

## Raspberry Pi 1A+

1. Originally came with my DV Mega, but I upgraded it.  Now sitting idle.

## Raspberry Pi Zero W

1. **CCTV cameras** Ã—2
  I have two of these operating as CCTV cameras for the house, running MotionEye, like the hub.

2. as above

3. **PAT server**
  I'm running this one as a PAT server so I can access my Winlink email from anywhere

1. **Portable MMDVM hotspot**
  Built a YSF/DMR/POCSAG hotspot for portable use, with a built-in battery.
