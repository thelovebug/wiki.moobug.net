## Brewing methods

=== "Inverted method"

    * Use 60g of ground coffee per litre of water, so 15g for a 250ml coffee
    * Assemble the Aeropress upside down, so the plunger is on the table
    * Place ground coffee in the inverted Aeropress
    * Using water that is just off the boil, pour over the ground coffee
    * Give a quick stir using the Aeropress paddle
    * Leave for 1 minute to brew
    * You may want to place a filter (moistened) into the cap and put the cap in place (carefully!) whilst you're waiting for the brew
    * After a minute, carefully place the Aeropress - the right way up - over a cup or mug
    * Slowly depress the plunger - try and take about 30 seconds
    * Stop plunging as soon as hissing is heard from the Aeropress
    * You get the best results and flavours from the coffee once it has cooled
