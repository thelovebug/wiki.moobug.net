## DTMF tones

Always make a point of disconnecting from a node before connecting to a new one, unless you're actually intending on joining them together.  Some node owners may not appreciate joining multiple nodes together, particularly if it's a large network of nodes.

### Connections

* `*156789` - disconnect from Allstar node `56789`
* `*356789` - connect to Allstar node `56789`
* `*76` - disconnect from all connected nodes

## Informational

* `*70` - will tell you which nodes your node is actually connected to

## RF link tones

RF links are usually accessed via physical IP phones or apps on a phone or computer, with no PTT button.

* `*99` - to key up
* `#` - to de-key
