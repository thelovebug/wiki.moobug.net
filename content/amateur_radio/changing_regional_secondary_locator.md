This is a new article, and thus a work in progress.

I've had a couple of occasions to change my RSL, both related to HM The Queen in some way or other.  There are a few things to change when doing this, so I'm making a list here of things that *__I__* have to do to accommodate it.

Where I have applied a specific Regional Secondary Locator against any of the items listed below, I will suffix them with the appropriate letter, currently `#`.

## Shack PC

* Change Callsign on WSJT-X, JS8Call, FLDigi.
* Change Callsign and Station ID in GridTracker

## Online services

* Change active logbook in Cloudlog, including creating a new logbook if not simply a geographical change. `#`
* Update QRZ page with relevant details, including creating a new Alias if the RSL has never been used before. `#`

## Messengers

* Change Telegram name `#`
* Change Signal name `#`
* Change Matrix name `#`
* Change Jitsi name `#`

## Social media

* Change Twitter name `#`
* Change Facebook nickname `#`
* Change Mastodon nicknames ([mastodon.co.uk](https://mastodon.co.uk/@thelovebug), [mastodon.radio](https://mastodon.radio/@m7tlb)) `#`
* Change Discord server profiles *(14, at last count)* `#`
