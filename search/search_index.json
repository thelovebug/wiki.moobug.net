But never have I seen as much vitriol as I have under the subject of Amateur Radio and what actually constitutes \"radio\" in that context.</p> <p>The Wikipedia page for Amateur Radio describes the hobby as:</p> <p>Quote</p> <p>Amateur radio, also known as ham radio, is the use of the radio frequency spectrum for purposes of non-commercial exchange of messages, wireless experimentation, self-training, private recreation, radiosport, contesting, and emergency communications.</p> <p>... or as I like to say: \"educate, experiment, entertain\".</p> <p>The scope and field of Amateur Radio is huge.  Starting from something as simple and straight-forward as picking up a radio and talking to another Amateur operator a mile away over the air, progressing through to something as complex as using a digital radio which connects to a hotspot which then connects to a central hub via the internet which is then picked up by an internet-connected repeater in another continent which is then picked up and heard by another operator with an analogue radio in the middle of a field somewhere.  You've also got your computer-to-computer (or data) modes, which allow you to send very narrow coded symbols over much larger distances than you could do with voice.  Then, of course, there's the ultimate person-to-person data mode, CW or Morse Code.</p>"},{"location":"amateur_radio/but_its_not_radio/#but-its-not-radio","title":"But it's not radio","text":"<p>I have been witness to some very measured (and, in other cases, incredibly vile) arguments regarding what \"radio\" actually is.  There are very many different interpretations around what \"radio\" means - particularly in the context of Amateur Radio.  Technically, none of them are wrong (although there is one particular use-case exception which I'll touch on in a bit).  Now, I want to qualify this by saying that, in the context of Amateur Radio, I'm defining \"radio\" as the use of the recognised Amateur Bands as defined by the ITU (and illustrated in this Wikipedia article).  I also want to make it clear that although some of the 13cm band overlaps with the 2.4GHz WiFi and Bluetooth allocations, I'm not counting the use of WiFi and Bluetooth as \"radio\" in this context.</p>"},{"location":"amateur_radio/but_its_not_radio/#yes-it-is","title":"Yes, it is","text":"<p>In my opinion, and in the spirit of Amateur Radio as defined above, any communication utilises the Amateur Radio bands at some point between the transmitter and the receiver, is \"radio\".</p>"},{"location":"amateur_radio/but_its_not_radio/#having-said-that","title":"Having said that","text":"<p>For as many different arguments and opinions of what \"radio\" is, there are as many about what a valid use of \"radio\" is in the context of the hobby.  I realise that this term may be offensive to some, but the spectrum of purism in the hobby is as wide as the scope of the hobby itself.  There are some who believe that if you're not talking over the air - direct radio to radio - with another operator, that's not \"radio\".  This discounts most of the data modes (because you're not actually having a conversation), the voice modes that are internet-assisted (because it's not radio end-to-end), any of the phone apps (Echolink, Droidstar, DVSwitch, etc) because they are basically internet, any of the SIP-based Voice Over IP mechanisms (which I mentioned over at my SIP Services page).</p> <p>And you know what... to a certain extent, I agree!  But does it actually matter?</p> <p>There is nothing more gratifying than picking up a microphone at your house and having a voice conversation - over the air - with another operator 1,000 miles away in Croatia (like I did earlier this week).  But sometimes the bands are quiet and there's no-one on there, or you're not in a position to be able to speak, or you want to do radio when you're in the middle of a field with a hand-held radio (rather than with your home radio and antenna that peaks 10 meters into the air), or you want to challenge yourself and see if you can make some kind of contact with a station over the other side of the world.  Depending on your circumstances (and license class), that simply may not be possible.  </p> <p>Let's say I want to speak with either of my friends Allan G7VQV or Mark 2E1CEQ over the radio.  They only live a couple hundred miles south of me, so it must be possible, right?  Wrong.  The conditions have to be right, and the equipment at either end has to be right for the conditions.  Well, basically, I don't have that.  So if I want to speak to them, I can either pick up my desk phone and call them on HamsOverIP, or I can pick up a radio and chat to them over Allstar (radio both ends, internet in the middle), or I could ping them on Jitsi (no radio at all) but where's the fun in that.</p> <p>A lot of these mechanisms that I've just mentioned - whilst they have the capability to interface with the Amateur Radio bands - are not inherently radio.  Services like Echolink, Peanut, SIP... but they have the capability of being interfaced with Amateur Radio.  I can pick up my phone, dial <code>25006</code> and be connected to the FreeSTAR Network.  By using my phone's keypad, I can \"key up\" and be heard around the world over the Amateur Bands.  So I may not start with radio, but it's in there somewhere.</p> <p>At the start of this article, I used the words \"educate, experiment, entertain\" to describe what I feel is the spirit of Amateur Radio.  It's certainly the reason why I got involved in it.  I have (educate) learned so much in the 3\u00bd years that I've had my license, I have (experiment) built my own antenna which has allowed me to be heard in Tazmania (~10,000mi away), I have (entertain) had an awful lot of fun in the process, and I have made some (excellent) friends on that journey.</p>"},{"location":"amateur_radio/but_its_not_radio/#whats-my-point","title":"What's my point","text":"<p>My point is very simple.</p> <p>What is \"radio\" for some may not be \"radio\" for others.

It will be used by the buttons in the next section in the file, so having the same value appear twice could end up with unexpected results.</li> <li><code>'/cgi-bin/lsnodes_web?node=99999&amp;command=*73'</code>    The value in the single quotes is the \"what happens when this action is invoked\" - in this case, it sends the command <code>*73</code> to the node, telling it to disconnect your node from all others.  Again, <code>99999</code> should be (and needs to be) your own Allstar node number.</li> </ol> <p>The simplest way to add a new action is to duplicate the last line in the list.  If you're using <code>nano</code> then that would be to place your text cursor on the line you want to duplicate and press Ctrl-K, Ctrl-U, Ctrl-U.  This effectively cuts the line, and then pastes it back twice.  If you're using another editor, then it's highly likely to be a different action.</p> <p>For creating a new action:</p> <ul> <li>change the unique identifier to be the Allstar node you want to connect to\\   e.g. 42732 for F-troop</li> <li>make sure the <code>node=</code> section has your Allstar node against it</li> <li>change the <code>command=</code> section to <code>*73*342732</code> \\   that's <code>*73</code> to disconnect, followed by <code>*3</code> which means \"connect to\" and <code>42732</code> which is the node you want to connect to</li> </ul> <p>So your newly created line would look something like this:</p> <pre><code>$('#42732').click(function() { $.ajax({ url: '/cgi-bin/lsnodes_web?node=99999&amp;command=*73*342732', }); });\n</code></pre> <p>Where <code>99999</code> should be your... blah blah, you get it.</p> <p>That's the action section done.</p>"},{"location":"amateur_radio/customising_g7rpg_web_interface/#buttons","title":"Buttons","text":"<p>These are the coloured buttons that appear in your web interface.</p> <p>If you scroll slightly down in your <code>index.php</code> file, just below the actions, you'll start to see four blocks of HTML, with headers as follows:</p> <ol> <li><code>&lt;!-- 1 --&gt;</code></li> <li><code>&lt;!-- 2 --&gt;</code></li> <li><code>&lt;!-- 3 --&gt;</code></li> <li><code>&lt;!-- 4 --&gt;</code></li> </ol> <p>These headers represent the columns within the web interface.

Each message contains (usually) three pieces of information: your callsign, my callsign, the message.  There are exceptions to this, but that's something that you can learn as you go along.</p> <p>A typical structured conversation can go something like this:</p> Direction Message Meaning Out <code>CQ M7TLB IO93</code> Calling anyone, I'm M7TLB, and I'm located at IO93 In <code>M7TLB 2E1CEQ -06</code> Hello M7TLB, I'm 2E1CEQ, and your signal to me is -06 Out <code>2E1CEQ M7TLB R-09</code> Hi 2E1CEQ, this is M7TLB again, thanks for that, your signal to me is -09 In <code>M7TLB 2E1CEQ RR73</code> Hey M7TLB, yup it's 2E1CEQ, thanks for your report, best wishes Out <code>2E1CEQ M7TLB 73</code> Thanks 2E1CEQ, best wishes from M7TLB <p>On FT8, this conversation takes place over 5 messages taking 15 seconds each to transmit/receive, so 75 seconds in total.

It is possible to put a small amount of free text into a message - up to 13 characters, I believe - but certainly not sufficient to have a meaningful conversation.

My record up to this point (2022-07-27) is from the UK to Australia... approximately 10,000 miles, with 10 watts and a piece of wire.</p> <p>The gold standard software for things like FT4 and FT8 is WSJT-X, which supports something like 10 different data modes overall.  So once you have that set up correctly, you can - in theory - use any of those modes.  WSJT-X interfaces with your radio using a soundcard and an interface cable.</p> <p>I wrote another article on Setting up FT8 on Linux with the Xiegu G90, but I'm sure it serves as a general purpose guide for setting WSJT-X up for any hardware configuration.. but it doesn't tell you how to use it.

For this, I bought myself a Baofeng UV-5RTP as a transceiver to speak to other people in my local area.  In the first four weeks of holding my licence, I spoke to 7 individuals, the furthest being just shy of 40 miles away.  As it happens, that was my first ever QSO (amateur radio contact), and I've not managed to beat that distance over-the-air yet.</p> <p>I'd heard about \"repeaters\" - essentially bridging stations that receive your transmission and then throw it out from there, giving you a greater range.  I was already messing around with a service called Echolink, which allows you to connect to some of these repeater stations over the internet.  This concept blew my mind when I first heard about it, thinking that using the internet to extend the range of traditional RF transmissions was an incredibly modern extension to the hobby.</p> <p>Then, by accident, I discovered a local repeater (with Echolink) called MB7ALC, based a few miles away from here.  I noticed that this was a really busy repeater, with unusually high traffic than I'd experienced on Echolink previously.  What really caught me by surprise was that someone on there was talking to someone else down in the South West of England (I'm in the North of England), so I'm thinking that this South West person must be pushing some power to be able to reach this far up the country.  During that conversation, I heard mention of AllStar and something called HUBnet.  Doing some research into HUBnet, I discovered that it's a network of repeaters and gateways on the AllStar network.  This essentially meant that although I was using my phone or laptop to connect into a local Echolink repeater, I was actually transmitting all over the country out of this network!  Suddenly I felt very small, in the middle of a very large community.</p> <p>In my first week of (unintentionally) using HUBnet, I managed to speak to other Amateur Radio operators in Weston-super-Mare (SW England), Liverpool (NW England), Dudley (Central England), Bolton (NW England), Kent (SE England), Pennsylvania (US), London, and... wait, what?  The US?  So at this point, I'm realising that this is an international network of repeaters and gateways.  This removes pretty much every possible barrier to communicating with the rest of the world, as long as they can access an AllStar node (over the air or over the internet) that's connected to HUBnet.  At the time of writing this, I'm counting 135 nodes - worldwide - connected to this network.</p> <p>The interesting thing about AllStar is that you can use it to connect one node to another - kinda like a telephone call - or you can bridge nodes together to form a network - which is how HUBnet works.  But you can also attach RF transmitters to these nodes and (with the right licence - that I don't currently have) make them available to any other Amateur operator within range, or just a really low-powered RF transmitter with a close range for personal use (my licence does cover that).</p> <p>I recently discovered a little gizmo box called the G7RPG microHUB.  G7RPG is the callsign of Pete, who designed and builds them - on request - for anyone that wants one.  I ordered one from him, and it took about a week to arrive.  It was \u00a3135 all-in, and I literally plugged it in and it was working.  The microHUB is a Raspberry Pi running Asterisk (which is basically an IP telephony package), with a low-powered transceiver built in.</p> <p>So, at this moment, I can \"radio\" in the following different ways:</p> <ul> <li>Traditional over-the-air RF radio using my little Baofeng</li> <li>Internet-assisted over-the-air using the Baofeng and the microHUB (at home only)</li> <li>Internet-assisted over-the-air using the Baofeng and a \"public\" repeater/gateway</li> <li>Internet-assisted using Echolink on my phone/tablet, or QTel on my laptop</li> <li>Many more different internet-assisted methods, like M17, using DudeStar/DroidStar</li> </ul> <p>I put \"public\" in quotes, as Amateur Radio still requires you to hold a valid licence to operate.</p> <p>In addition to Amateur Radio (internet-assisted or not), there are other technologies that have been made available to Amateur operators that don't - in and of themselves - use the Amateur Radio network.  One of them is Voice over IP (VoIP).  It's an telephone system, like your normal landline, but it's a closed system with private extension numbers issued to each phone on the network.  I currently have accounts on five different SIP Services.</p> <p>So recently purchased a Cisco SPA525G2 IP phone (I previously had an SPA514G, but now my XYL/SWL has that) to connect to all my various services.  I already had a Sipgate phone number, so I assigned that to the SPA, plus four of the other five services.  IP telephony is a portable system, as it's based on the phone itself, not on the location of the phone.  So I could unplug the phone, take it to my mum's house, plug it into her network, and it would just carry on working.</p> <p>Then I got to thinking that AllStar service (and therefore the microHUB) is essentially an Asterisk server itself, so I wanted to see if it was possible to connect my Cisco IP phone to the microHUB as an alternative to using my Baofeng UV-5RTP to connect to it... therefore making the phone my rig in the \"shack\"!</p> <p>If you want to know the steps I went through to make this happen, go here.</p> <p>You can view most of my shack kit on my QRZ page.</p> <p>73 de Dave M7TLB</p>"},{"location":"coffee/","title":"Coffee","text":"<ul> <li>Aeropress how to 'press</li> </ul>"},{"location":"coffee/aeropress/","title":"Aeropress","text":"<p>Aeropress is one of my favourite bean/ground coffee brewing options... and I have a few!</p>"},{"location":"coffee/aeropress/#brewing-methods","title":"Brewing methods","text":"Inverted method <ul> <li>Use 60g of ground coffee per litre of water, so 15g for a 250ml coffee</li> <li>Assemble the Aeropress upside down, so the plunger is on the table</li> <li>Place ground coffee in the inverted Aeropress</li> <li>Using water that is just off the boil, pour over the ground coffee</li> <li>Give a quick stir using the Aeropress paddle</li> <li>Leave for 1 minute to brew</li> <li>You may want to place a filter (moistened) into the cap and put the cap in place (carefully!) whilst you're waiting for the brew</li> <li>After a minute, carefully place the Aeropress - the right way up - over a cup or mug</li> <li>Slowly depress the plunger - try and take about 30 seconds</li> <li>Stop plunging as soon as hissing is heard from the Aeropress</li> <li>You get the best results and flavours from the coffee once it has cooled</li> </ul>"},{"location":"games/","title":"Games","text":"<p>Lots of games resources (eventually)</p> <ul> <li>Wordle games lots of Wordle-style games</li> </ul>"},{"location":"games/wordle_games/","title":"Wordle-style games","text":""},{"location":"games/wordle_games/#word-games","title":"Word games","text":"<ul> <li>Wordle the original</li> <li>WordHurdle six letters, not five</li> <li>Absurdle variant of Wordle that is just mad</li> <li>Quordle four Wordles at the same time</li> </ul>"},{"location":"games/wordle_games/#specialised-games","title":"Specialised games","text":"<ul> <li>Trekle like Wordle, but for Star Trek fans</li> </ul>"},{"location":"games/wordle_games/#number-games","title":"Number games","text":"<ul> <li>Nerdle Wordle for maths nerds</li> </ul>"},{"location":"games/wordle_games/#music-games","title":"Music games","text":"<ul> <li>Heardle guess the song in the first few seconds</li> </ul>"},{"location":"games/wordle_games/#not-for-kids","title":"Not for kids","text":"<p>Exercise discretion!</p> <ul> <li>Sweardle four letter words</li> <li>Lewdle rude words, Urban Dictionary style</li> </ul>"},{"location":"lists/","title":"Lists","text":"<p>Lists of things</p> <ul> <li> <p> Books</p> <p>Books and book series that I'm reading or want to read</p> </li> <li> <p> Films</p> <p>Films and film franchises that are among my favourite of all time</p> </li> <li> <p> Raspberry Pis</p> <p>Raspberry Pis and how they're being used here</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"lists/books/","title":"Books","text":"<ul> <li>A number in brackets is the number of available books for that author that are on my reading list but unread</li> <li>A  in the headings means I've read everything for that author that's on my reading list</li> </ul> Neil Bullock  #
